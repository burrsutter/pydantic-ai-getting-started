Video tutorial

Original tutorial files

https://github.com/daveebbelaar/pydantic-ai-tutorial

I broke them up into individually runnable "programs".


To run

```
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-1xMQkJtFDA8BMp2
```

I did modify Dave's requirements.txt for `pydantic-ai>=0.0.9`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python hello.py
```


```
python 5_agent_reflection_self_correction.py
```
